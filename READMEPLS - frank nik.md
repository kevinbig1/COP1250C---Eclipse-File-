This is the Java Tutor file as exported from Eclipse, let me know if you can access it and if it looks good! I've yet to add comments to my parts of the project (module for data types and loops), just waiting on yalls input before I do! 
Also let me know if theres anything else I had to do coding wise, project wise, well anything wise!
